## Project Overview

The project was divided into four main phases:
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Designed using [draw.io]
- **Schema Design:** Focused on proper normalization and implementation of data integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints).
- **Data Generation & Manipulation:** Utilized DML (Data Manipulation Language) to populate tables with generated data, followed by manual adjustments to better fit query needs.
- **SQL Queries:** Included commands for table creation, data insertion, and data retrieval to answer specific business questions.
